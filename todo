Good evening Mr. Dewen Honawale, this is flask application. 
The dynamic charts is displayed on the front end. 
Current version displays just random values on chart. 

- Flask sends numeric data stored in a string to client needs to be plotted on actual chart. 
- Modify the given javascript code in html file to plot actual data sent by the server(flask). 

For plotting dynamic chart we are using Plotly.js Library. 
If you need more detailed explanation, we can have a meeting.
